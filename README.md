## Brief Introduction
This mini machine learning project contains two main tasks. The first task is aimed to build a classifier to identify whether there is a tumor in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. The second task is aimed to build a classifier to identify the type of tumor in each MRI image (meningioma tumor, glioma tumor, pituitary tumor or no tumor).

An image-based dataset containing MRI scans of human brain is provided (3000 512x512 pixel gray-scale MRI images organized in 4 classes). A separated test set with 200 images is provided as well, the test set is to check whether machine learning models are overfitted.
