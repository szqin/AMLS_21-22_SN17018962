## Brief Introduction
This mini machine learning project contains two main tasks. The first task is aimed to build a classifier to identify whether there is a tumor in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. The second task is aimed to build a classifier to identify the type of tumor in each MRI image (meningioma tumor, glioma tumor, pituitary tumor or no tumor).

An image-based dataset containing MRI scans of human brain is provided (3000 512x512 pixel gray-scale MRI images organized in 4 classes). A separated test set with 200 images is provided as well, the test set is to check whether machine learning models are overfitted.

## Brief Description of Files
A training dataset with 3000 MRI images and a corresponding label csv file.

An optional dataset with 200 MRI images and a corresponding label csv file.

The main.ipynb file contains all code to solve Task 1 and Task 2.

Other files generated when running the code.

## Run the Code
Please download the dataset zip file (3000 MRI images and label csv file): [Download Link](http://shorturl.at/hquDP) (file size is too large to upload).

Please download the testing dataset zip file (200 MRI images and label csv file) in this repository: *AMLS-2021_test.zip*

After downloading these two data sets, plase download main.ipynb file in this repository. The way to run the code is outlined in the "Run the Code" section in main.ipynb file.
## Packages Used
OpenCV, Numpy, pandas, sci-kit learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pickle, and itertools, etc.
